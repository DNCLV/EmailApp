# EmailApp
The Email App is a program to generate email accounts with a random generated password using first name and last name aswell as respective departments at a given firm.

The program also allows the user to reference an alternate email aswell as change the random generated password to a more memorable one.

The Email App can easily be used to generate a large number of emails with attached password to avoid inputting first name, last name, department and company for every induvidual who needs a new email address. 
Instead the program takes in scanner inputs for efficiency, where the only information that needs to be typed, is first name and last name for every indiviual.

The program uses the following:

* java.util.Scanner;
* Getters and Setters
* Conditional statements
* Math.random
* For loops
